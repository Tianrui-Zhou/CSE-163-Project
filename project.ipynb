    "   This research aims to analyze the trend of EV adoption over recent years, examining growth rates across different regions and identifying any accelerating or plateauing patterns.\n",

    "2. **What is the relationship between EV registration rates by ZIP code and the number of public charging stations in those areas?**  \n",
    "   This study will analyze whether areas with more public charging infrastructure experience higher rates of EV adoption and assess whether a lack of charging stations poses a barrier to growth.\n",

    "   This research analysis will investigate the extent to which increasing EV adoption has contributed to reductions in transportation-related GHG emissions and whether these effects vary across different regions.\n"

    "## Challenge Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Multiple Datasets:\n",
    "- **Electric Vehicles Population Data from 1999 to 2025 of Washington State**:  \n",
    "  [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)  \n",
    "- **Up-to-date Public Electric Vehicle Charging Station Locations in Washington State**:  \n",
    "  [Public EV Charging Stations](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations#/analyze?country=US&region=US-WA)  \n",
    "- **Washington State Greenhouse Gas Emission Data from 2012 to 2017**:  \n",
    "  [WA GHG Reporting Multi-Year Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/wa-ghg-reporting-multi-year-dataset)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our project will utilize three datasets: EV registration data, charging station data, and GHG emissions data. At least two research questions involve combining datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **EV registration data and charging station data** will be merged to analyze the relationship between charging infrastructure and EV adoption.  \n",
    "- **EV registration data and GHG emissions data** will be combined to assess the impact of EV adoption on emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Advanced Machine Learning\n",
    "We will employ machine learning to predict EV adoption rates based on charging infrastructure and socioeconomic factors. Specifically, we will compare at least three scikit-learn algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, and Support Vector Machine) to identify the best model for predicting EV adoption.\n"

    "# Data Setting\n",
    "### 1. Electric Vehicle Population Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source**: [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)  \n",
    "**Description**: This dataset contains information on EV registrations in Washington State, including vehicle type, location (ZIP code), and model year.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Source**: [Alternative Fueling Station Locator](https://afdc.energy.gov/stations#/analyze?country=US&region=US-WA)  \n",
    "**Description**: This dataset provides the locations of public charging stations, including ZIP code and station type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. WA GHG Reporting Multi-Year Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source**: [WA GHG Reporting Multi-Year Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/wa-ghg-reporting-multi-year-dataset)  \n",
    "**Description**: This dataset contains greenhouse gas emissions data by sector, including transportation, for Washington State.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Data Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Period Misalignment**: The datasets cover different time ranges (EV data: 1999-2025, GHG data: 2012-2017, charging stations: 2024). We will standardize our analysis by selecting overlapping time periods where necessary.\n",
    "- **Geospatial Differences**: Some datasets report data at the ZIP code level, while others use counties. We may need to aggregate or disaggregate data accordingly.\n",
    "- **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Some data have missing or incomplete values, necessitating careful handling of missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Collection and Process\n",
    "\n",
    "We will import and clean data from our datasets using libraries like Pandas in Python. This involves handling missing values, filtering and dropping unnecessary values, ensuring consistency across datasets, and preparing them for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Manipulation & Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning up the datasets, we will create subsets by geographic regions, such as ZIP codes or counties, or chronologically. The data will then be aggregated at different levels to analyze EV registration rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize Seaborn and Geospatial DataFrames to create visualizations that highlight both spatial and statistical relationships in our data. Seaborn will be used for correlation and regression plots to illustrate trends in EV adoption over time and across regions. Meanwhile, Geospatial DataFrames will help analyze geographic patterns in EV registrations and public charger distribution. These visualizations will be instrumental in identifying regional disparities, infrastructure gaps, and the relationship between EV adoption and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, we will apply machine learning techniques to generate predictive insights and further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use machine learning models from Scikit-learn to analyze the relationship between EV adoption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. By applying regression models and hypothesis tests, we will evaluate the connection between EV adoption and emission reductions. This statistical analysis will help quantify the impact of EV adoption on lowering transportation-related emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Conclusions & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will interpret the findings to provide insights for policymakers and stakeholders. The results will be summarized in a structured report, with recommendations on how to improve EV adoption rates and optimize charging infrastructure for maximum environmental benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure our functions work correctly and are not biased, we will create small test datasets with missing values, extra data, and edge cases. Then, we will run our functions on these datasets to check if they handle different situations properly."
